    <subject>{!Lead.Name}, it was great meeting you at DF &apos;15!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name},

We hope you had a great Dreamforce.  It was a pleasure to meet you in the DevZone.  I want to personally thank you for your support of making our week an Awesome one as we had a huge positive response for AutoRABIT.

Now that we&apos;ve all had week to recover from the event, we welcome the opportunity to schedule a personalized discussion with you and your team for next steps with AutoRABIT.

I&apos;ve included our Data Sheet with details on the features and benefits along with an Implementation Questionnaire which will give us some insights on your environment, current challenges and goals you would like to achieve with AutoRABIT.

Let us know a couple of calendar slots you would prefer for next steps which we can schedule upon receipt of the questionnaire.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
