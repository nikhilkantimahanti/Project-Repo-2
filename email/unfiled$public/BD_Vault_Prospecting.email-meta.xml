    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


I hope you are well. My name is Brian and I am the new expert for AutoRabit’s backup and recovery platform for Salesforce data and metadata.


You utilize our release management automation platform, so I am reaching out to schedule time to discuss how you are protect your Salesforce today and how it compares to best practices and Salesforce’s recommendation. As you probably are aware, Salesforce discontinued assisting organizations in the event of a data loss or corruption this July 31st. (https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000322731&amp;type=1&amp;mode=1).


Let me know if a half hour tomorrow at 2:00 PM EST or Thursday at 1:00 PM EST works for you. If not, let me know a better time for you.


Best,

Brian Doyle

Enterprise Account Executive, AutoRABIT
