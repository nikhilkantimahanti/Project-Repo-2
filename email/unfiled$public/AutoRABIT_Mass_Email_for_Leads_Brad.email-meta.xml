    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow-up and see if now was a good time to revisit using AutoRABIT to help you automate your Salesforce release management process.  

Automation and Continuous Integration:
Have you been thinking about automating part of your Release Management process? Have you seen a demo of AutoRABIT yet? 

Evaluating AutoRABIT made easy:
We have created our “Playground” environment which makes the evaluation process of AutoRABIT much easier, less time consuming and alleviates the need for security clearance.  

The Playground also allows you to quickly and properly evaluate AutoRABIT so you can go to management with more confidence to request approval and obtain budget. 

AutoRABIT 3.9 Release:
We have have also made significant improvements with our latest release  - http://www.autorabit.com/autorabit-3-9-ga-release-highlights-salesforce-release-management/

Looking forward to hearing from you and helping you get to a faster and easier release management environment.

Thanks
