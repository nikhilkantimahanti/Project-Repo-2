    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},


We hope you had a great World Tour NY experience.  It was a pleasure to meet you at the event.  I want to personally thank you for your support of making our day an awesome one as we had a huge positive response for AutoRABIT.


Now that we’ve all had a week to recover from the event, we welcome the opportunity to schedule a personalized discussion with you and the {!Lead.Company} Salesforce development team for next steps with AutoRABIT.


I’ve included a Link for Data Sheet with details on the features and benefits along with a Link for Implementation Questionnaire which will give us some insights on your environment, current challenges and goals you would like to achieve with AutoRABIT.


Let us know a couple of calendar slots you would prefer for next steps.


Thank you for your time and consideration.
